  "body": "Translating a game or an app can be boring and very dificult sometimes.\r\nNow, with the Transalte plugin, it's a bit easy !\r\n\r\n##Setup##\r\nFirst, [download the project from github][1], then extract it to a folder in your C2/plugin folder.\r\nRestart construct 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n##File format##\r\nThe file is JSON. If you don't know JSON, you can read about it [here][2]\r\nThe format is simple : \r\n\r\n[image description][3]\r\n\r\n    default_language\r\n\r\nIt's the language by default, if you didn't choose anyone.\r\n\r\n    availables\r\n\r\nIt's the list of supported languages. Don't put a language here if you didn't translate the all the fields (NOTE : If a field is not available in the selected langauge, **default_language** will be used)\r\n\r\n    play_button next_button greeting_text\r\n\r\nYou'll have to enter these name to retrieve the according translation. Make sure you choose simple names otherwise you'll have to keep an eye every time on your transaltion file.\r\n\r\nInside these names, you will have to enter the translation according to a key:value system.\r\nWhere key is your language and value is the translation.\r\n\r\nI think it's all for this part :)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Event sheet##\r\nNow, let's go to the construct part !  \r\nThe first you have to do, is to load the translation file you've just made.\r\nFor this, there are two ways.\r\n\r\n#Retrieving the file - Local#\r\n\r\nPut the file inside your project files and make an AJAX request (it's a native plugin) to retrieve it's data\r\n\r\nThen load the retrieved value with the Load action of the transalte plugin.\r\nJust put **AJAX.LastData** inside the field.\r\n\r\n[image description][4]\r\n\r\n#Retrieving the file - Distant#\r\nImagine you don't want to translate the file yourself.\r\nPut the file on a communautary website like github and instead of making an ajax request to a project file, make it to the raw url to the transaltion file. \r\nYou now just have to let people do the work on you public repository, validate  the changes and the project is translated. No need to update the project.\r\nCAUTION : If your project can also run offline make sure to have a copy of the file inside the project, otherwise, there probably be a problem when your user have no connection, haha ...\r\n\r\n#Managing translations#\r\n[image description][5]\r\n\r\nMake an update function that you can call directly on the begining of the layout and also when the user change the language.\r\n\r\nSet the text of each of your object to \r\n    Translate.GetValue(\"play_button\", \"\")\r\n\r\nNote that this function take two parameters.\r\nThe first parameter is the string you defined in your JSON file.\r\nThe second parameters is to pass parameter to the string.\r\nIn my JSON file, I have defined that a field will take parameters : \r\n[image description][10]\r\n\r\nThe parameter are between \"$\"\r\nTo replace these parameters, fill the second parameter of the plugion action like this : \r\n\r\n\"wordbetween$:variable;secondwordbetween$:variable;\"\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n[image description][7]\r\n\r\nI think now you are ready ! If you have any questions fell free to ask on[the forum][11] or on the [c2 discord server][8]\r\n\r\nEnjoy ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on a TheRealDannyyy idea.\r\n\r\n[1][https://github.com/armaldio/c2-translate/archive/master.zip]\r\n[2][https://www.wikiwand.com/fr/JavaScript_Object_Notation]\r\n[3][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/15NcDR95.png]\r\n[4][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/ajax.jpg]\r\n[5][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/Construct 2 beta release r226 (Administrator) - translations.capx - Event sheet 1.png]\r\n[7][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/short.png]\r\n[8][https://discord.gg/0eLPLj96B4v33etP]\r\n[9][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/ccc.png]\r\n[10][https://www.scirra.com/images/articles/dddd.png]\r\n[11][https://www.scirra.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=153&t=173194]",
